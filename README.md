<h3 align ="left"> <strong> 1. About it </strong> </h3>
<p> This is a simple console that I practice during my free time when I was a freshman. I was ordering doordash and really like their UX, then I came up with the idea of "Hmm why can't I practice programming and my user the same experience as I had". Therefore I made this.
  This program can be used by customers and the sellers. <br>
  When starting the program, the Home Menu with two options will appears to the users.<br>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The first option is for customers to buy food through the <em>"Open Menu"</em> option. <br></li>
    <li>The second option is for sellers to check the amount of food was sold and sales of the day.</li></ul> </p>
<h3> <strong> 2. What I have learned </strong> </h3>
<p>
1. The importants of input and output <br>
2. Creating and using methods <br>
3. Looping and exiting which allows users to exit whenever they want <br>
4. Simple concept about User Experience.
